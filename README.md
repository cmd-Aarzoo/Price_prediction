# 🏡 House Price Prediction

Welcome to the **House Price Prediction** project by **Aarzoo Babu**. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, and more.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates the selling price of a house given its features. This kind of system can be helpful for:

- Real estate businesses
- Individual buyers or sellers
- Market trend analysis

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**

## 📊 Features Used

- Location
- Size (Square Feet)
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms
- Availability of amenities (e.g., parking, garden)
- BHK (Bedrooms-Hall-Kitchen)

## 🔧 Model Building Steps

1. **Data Collection** – Raw housing data gathered from reliable sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, outlier removal, etc.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizing distributions and feature correlations.
4. **Model Selection** – Multiple regression models tested (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.).
5. **Model Evaluation** – Using metrics like RMSE, R² Score.
6. **Model Deployment (optional)** – Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit.
